    By default, the python command runs extremely slow or never actually opens up the python interpreter on git bash.
    To fix this, we need to create an alias for the python command.
    Open or create the .bashrc file. This will open the nano editor.

nano .bashrc

    Add the following line to this file. 
alias python='winpty python'
    Press Ctrl-X to exit out of the file. It will ask to save the file. 
    Type Y for Yes and Press ENTER to save and exit.

source .bashrc
    This will enable the alias for the remainder of your bash session. 
    Note that this will also be enabled when you run git bash next time
